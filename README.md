### vx

A collection of reusable low-level visualization components. Super beta. Hold off on using this in production until I shake out some of the bigger API problems (`v1.0.0+`).

## Motiviation

Don't copy and paste d3 code into `componentDidMount()`. Mixing two mental models for updating the DOM is never a good time. This collection of components lets you easily build your own reusable visualization charts or library.

## Examples

+ [Simple line chart](https://github.com/hshoff/vx/blob/master/packages/vx-demo/src/demos/charts/SimpleAreaChart.js)
+ [Simple area chart](https://github.com/hshoff/vx/blob/master/packages/vx-demo/src/demos/charts/SimpleAreaChart.js)
